## Going Further

There is room for improvement if you feel like continuing the project

- [x] Build a custom geometry for the roof (see TODO comment in code)
- [ ] Add more tweaks for things like the lights, the colors, the textures repetitions, the ghost speed, etc.
- [ ] Add tweaks to the Sky as seen in the [example](https://threejs.org/examples/?q=sky#webgl_shaders_sky) (the [code](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/master/examples/webgl_shaders_sky.html))
- [ ] Stray away from the cube house and add more shapes to it like a garage, a tool shed, toilets in the back or whatever
- [ ] Add more objects to the scene (fences, pathways, rocks, wood signs, windows, etc.); once you're done learning how to import models, you can get back to this lesson
- [ ] Explore the Basis format
- [ ] Add sounds
- [x] Make the door light flicker
- Etc.
