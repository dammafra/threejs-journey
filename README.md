# Three.js Journey

## Setup

Run this followed commands:

```bash
# Install dependencies (only the first time)
npm install

# Run the local server at localhost:5173
npm run dev

```

## Going Further

- [ ] Test different colors
- [ ] Tweak the shift
- [ ] Improve the way we handle the color gradient
- [ ] Put some objects floating on the surface of the sea (youâ€™ll have to calculate the wave in JS)
- [ ] Make the depth of the waves more emissive
- [ ] Add more lights
- [ ] Animate the lights
