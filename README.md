## Going Further

- [ ] Add more particles. We have been a bit shy and you can add a lot more particles.
- [ ] Add default parameters to the createFirework function.
- [ ] Add more parameters to the firework function.
- [ ] Have different colors instead of a uniform color.
- [ ] Improve how particles are positioned in the sphere. The technique we used tends to concentrate particles on the poles.
- [ ] Add sound.
- [ ] Handle other shapes than a sphere. You could even try with the geometry of a loaded model.
