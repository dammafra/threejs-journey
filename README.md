# Three.js Journey

## Setup

Download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
Run this followed commands:

```bash
# Install dependencies (only the first time)
npm install

# Run the local server at localhost:5173
npm run dev

# Build for production in the dist/ directory
npm run build
```

## Going Further

As always, feel free to go further. Here are some suggestions:

- [ ] Add a uniform to control the color
- [ ] Animate the slicing on whatever user interaction
- [ ] Test with your own model
- [ ] Create a more fancy reveal than a radial slicing. Why donâ€™t you try using the Simplex Noise?
