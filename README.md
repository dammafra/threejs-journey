## Going Further

Feel free to explore the various effects and take them a step further.

You can also improve the custom effect weâ€™ve created. Here are some areas of improvement:

- [ ] Add a uniform to control the color instead of a fixed green and add its corresponding attribute.
- [ ] Add an attribute to control the animation speed.
- [ ] Add a debug UI to control those attributes.
