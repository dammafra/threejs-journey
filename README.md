## Going further

Here are some ideas:

- [ ] Make the axe obstacle look like an actual balancing axe
- [ ] More traps variations
- [ ] Control over the trap size (currently itâ€™s 4 and we had to write it in many places, but this information could come from the store)
- [ ] Better scenery (it feels a little empty)
- [ ] A boost key
- [ ] Boost bonuses that are spread across the level
- [ ] Different difficulties
- [ ] Sounds
- [ ] Particles
- [ ] Marble customisation
- [ ] Lasers that kill you instantly
