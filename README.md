## Going Further

- [ ] Try to add foam
- [ ] Attempt to enlarge the plane
- [ ] Adding fog would be a great way to get a more immersive experience that would enhance the feeling of being lost in the sea. Be careful though, adding fog will be more challenging than what we saw because you need to write the code for that fog on your own.
