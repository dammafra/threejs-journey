# Three.js Journey

## Setup

Download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
Run this followed commands:

```bash
# Install dependencies (only the first time)
npm install

# Run the local server at localhost:5173
npm run dev

# Build for production in the dist/ directory
npm run build
```

## Going Further

- [ ] Add more tweaks (particle count, particle size, various intensities, and thresholds).
- [ ] Add color to the particles like a nice gradient from one corner to the other.
- [ ] Make the particles move slowly all the time to add more life.
- [ ] Try other pictures.
