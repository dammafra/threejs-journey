# Three.js Journey

## Setup

Download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
Run this followed commands:

```bash
# Install dependencies (only the first time)
npm install

# Run the local server at localhost:5172
npm run dev

# Build for production in the dist/ directory
npm run build
```

## Going Further

As always, feel free to go further. Here are some suggestions:

- [ ] Add more tweaks. You can control the time frequency, the decay, the influence frequency, etc.
- [ ] Test with other models. Be careful, the model needs to be adapted to the effect with a lot of well-spread vertices.
- [ ] Give a global direction to the flowField, like in Chartogne Taillet where the particles seem to be pushed upward.
- [ ] Improve the look of the particles with something more fancy than the discs.
- [ ] Control the effect according to the cursor. Be careful, this one is a little bit tricky.
