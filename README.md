## Going Further

Feel free to go further. Here are some suggestions:

- [ ] Improve the fragment shader and try new effects
- [ ] Use your own model
- [ ] Apply this knowledge to the Raging Sea in order to use `MeshPhysicalMaterial`
- [ ] Add sound and make the wobble react according to the volume and frequency of that sound
