# Three.js Journey

## Setup

Download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
Run this followed commands:

```bash
# Install dependencies (only the first time)
npm install

# Run the local server at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# Build for production in the dist/ directory
npm run build
```

## Going Further

You can try to

- [ ] Add more tweaks
- [x] There is a lot of particles at the end of the branches; you can use the same technique we did with the power in order to have more particles at the center than particles on the outside
- [ ] Test other galaxy shapes
- [ ] Use a texture for the particles (use less particles to avoid performance issues)
- [x] Rotate the galaxy
- [ ] Create multiple galaxies
- Etc.

We will learn how to animate all the particles separatly in a future lesson.
