# Three.js Journey

## Setup

Download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
Run this followed commands:

```bash
# Install dependencies (only the first time)
npm install

# Run the local server at localhost:5173
npm run dev

# Build for production in the dist/ directory
npm run build
```

## Going Further

- Keep an eye on the performances from the start. Test on other devices, use the tools we saw initially and fix any strange behavior before going further.
- Each project will have different constraints, and applying those tips won't always suffice. Try to find solutions. Twist the way you are doing things. Be smart.
- You'll find a better way of doing things throughout your projects, and you'll adapt more quickly. At a point, you'll even know multiple ways of getting the same result, and you'll have the luxury to pick the best one.
