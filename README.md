# Three.js Journey

## Setup

Run this followed commands:

```bash
# Install dependencies (only the first time)
npm install

# Run the local server at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# Build for production in the dist/ directory
npm run build
```

## Going further

- [ ] Add more tweaks, like for the halftone direction, low, and high (donâ€™t forget that the direction length must be 1).
- [ ] Refactor the halftone function. It can be written in a much shorter way.
- [ ] Add a gradient to the halftone instead of the uniform color.
- [ ] Add an alpha parameter to the halftone in order to fade it in the color.
- [ ] Try to draw different shapes than a disc.
